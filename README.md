Topic:  Implementation of the builder design pattern for book management
Project Description: 
Project demonstrates the application of the Builder design pattern in Java.
The system implements the step-by-step creation of Book objects, where all details (title, author, number of pages, genre, language, publisher) are specified through the Director and Builder. The user does not need to enter data manually, instead, the Director provides ready-made templates, such as Novel or Textbook.
The main goal of the project is to show how the Builder pattern can be used to separate the process of building an object from its representation, making the code cleaner, more flexible, and more extensible.
